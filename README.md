# splashscreen_exoplayer

1) I have first made a splashscreen without using any activity.
2) Then I imported exoplayer libraries.
3) After that, I made a raw folder and put my downloaded video in it. Also I put one image in my drawable for splash screen.
4) I used navigation graph.
5) In my first screen I used videoplayer and in second I made a simple screen. So, when video will be finished we will directly navigate to our second screen
